<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial request was to continue work on their Golfinmallorca.com project. The primary goal evolved into a complete, major UI/UX redesign to give the site a modern, dynamic, and less classic feel, based on user-provided inspiration. This session focused on executing that redesign.

Over the course of the session, the user's requests included:
- Implementing an Ink Wash color palette (charcoal, cream, slate blue).
- Creating a new layout with a fixed left-side reviews sidebar, inspired by a design reference provided by the user.
- Improving the reviews section with platform logos (Google, Trustpilot, etc.).
- Replacing the text-based logo with a new transparent image logo, handling its color on different backgrounds, and linking it to an external booking site.
- Adding social media icons to the footer.
- Improving the hero section's scroll indicator.
- Increasing the navbar menu text size.
- A request to replace placeholder images for hotels and restaurants with their actual, official photos.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Implement a full website redesign based on user's inspiration and approved Ink Wash color palette.
- Implement an admin dashboard for content management (Upcoming).
- Ensure all interactive elements are functional and provide good UX.
- Fix broken email functionality (Blocked).
- Display authentic images for all partners (In Progress).

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack premium golf booking website for Mallorca (Golfinmallorca.com). The application uses a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and is configured for MongoDB, although all data (golf courses, hotels, restaurants) is currently hardcoded in .

The UI has been significantly overhauled in this session:
- The old purple/olive theme has been replaced with a modern Ink Wash palette (charcoal, cream, slate blue).
- A new layout features a fixed reviews sidebar on the left that appears after scrolling past the hero section.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** Finding and replacing placeholder stock photos for hotels and restaurants with their *actual* official images.
- **Reasoning:** The agent initially proposed using high-quality stock photos, but the user explicitly rejected this, stating you need to pull the actual photos, no use nice stock pics. The agent then pivoted to using web search to find the official websites for each establishment to source authentic images.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** After updating the image URLs in , the agent should use the  tool on the hotels and restaurants sections of the live site to verify the new, correct images are loading.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1:** Placeholder images for hotels and restaurants need to be replaced with actual photos. (Priority: P0)

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
**Upcoming Tasks:**
- **(P0) Admin Dashboard Implementation:** Build the simple admin dashboard the user requested to manage content (show/hide, edit, delete cards).

**Future Tasks:**
- **(P2) Add Hero Video:** Replace the static hero image with a video.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- **Issue 1: Webpack Deprecation Warnings** (Same as pending issue list, low priority).

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, . State management is done via React hooks (, ).
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python).
- **Database:** MongoDB is configured but unused. All data is hardcoded in .
- **Architecture:** Monorepo with  and  services. The frontend now has a more complex layout driven by scroll position to show/hide the .

**key DB schema**
- No database is currently in use. A schema will need to be designed for the upcoming Admin Dashboard task.

**changes in tech stack**
- No changes were made to the core technologies.

**All files of reference**
- : The source of all application data. Needs to be edited to replace placeholder image URLs.
- : Heavily modified to implement the new conditional two-column layout with the .
- : A new component created to house the entire left-side reviews panel.
- : Modified to use the new image logo, adjust text sizes, and handle logo color changes.
- : Modified to add the new scroll indicator and fix layout bugs.
- : Modified to add social media icons and the new logo.
-  & : Updated with the new Ink Wash color palette.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- **Data Source:** Migrating all hardcoded data from  to a MongoDB database is the most critical refactoring needed. This is a prerequisite for the Admin Dashboard.
- ** Component:** While refactored for the new layout, it still contains a lot of structural code. The main sections (Golf, Hotels, Restaurants) could be further encapsulated into their own components.

**key api endpoints**
- : Retrieves all course, hotel, and restaurant data.
- : Broken due to missing Resend API key.
- : Broken due to missing Resend API key.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **User is highly design-sensitive:** Pay extremely close attention to visual feedback. The user often provides inspiration images and specific instructions on colors, layout, and branding.
- **Find ACTUAL images:** The immediate priority is to replace placeholder images with *actual* photos from the official websites of the hotels and restaurants. Do not use generic stock photos.
- **Admin Dashboard is the next big feature:** Once the image task is complete, the user will likely want to start on the admin dashboard. This will be a significant undertaking involving database migration and API creation.
- **Browser Caching is an issue:** Always instruct the user to perform a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) or use an incognito window to verify changes.
- **Logo Color:** The golden amber color on the hero logo is achieved with a custom CSS . It reverts to its original dark color when scrolled onto the white navbar.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
- None.

The tasks for the admin dashboard and custom booking URLs have been correctly postponed based on the user's immediate focus.</analysis>
